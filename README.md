In this discussion we cover the basics of Javascript.

### Theory
You can find theoretic examples in the ```Theory``` folder.
There are 7 examples in the ```./js``` folder.
The ```index.html``` file contains includes for all of them.
Please uncomment only one of them at a time. The exmaples were not designed to be used simultaneously.

### Practical Example
There's a practical example in the ```Example``` folder.
It extends the LotR pages from discussion I by adding some interactivity.
